TaskFlow
# Overview
Taskflow is a team task management application developed 
to solve the problem of task progress management and information sharing among team members.
In conventional task management, information is scattered across emails, 
chat tools and spreedsheets, making it difficult to grasp the overall progress and share information.
This application allows all team members to centrally manage tasks, track progress in real-time, 
and share information efficiently.
